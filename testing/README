Getting started
===============

The profiling algorithm implemented in this library is described in 
the paper "Mining hot calling contexts in small space", ACM PLDI '11.

Reading the paper is highly recommended before starting. Paper available at
www.dis.uniroma1.it/~demetres/didattica/ae/upload/papers/pldi149-delia.pdf

To compile the profiling libraries and tools, just:

$ make

You need write access to /usr/local/lib, otherwise copy the libraries as 
root from libs/ and symlink your default profiling tool to libhcct.so

To instrument a program, manually edit the Makefile or run ./configure 
with environment variables:

CFLAGS="-finstrument-functions -g"
LDFLAGS="-rdynamic -lhcct -lpthread -Wl,-wrap,pthread_create \
		-Wl,-wrap,pthread_exit"
		
If you plan to use MMX/SSE instructions, in newer gcc versions you should
add "-finstrument-functions-exclude-file-list=mmintrin.h,xmmintrin.h" to
the CFLAGS environment variable.

When a program foo is executed, several foo-<TID>.tree are created (one 
per thread), plus an additional file foo.map mirroring /proc/self/maps.

You can specify additional parameters as environment variables. For 
instance, try one of the test programs:

DUMPPATH="/tmp" EPSILON=0.0001 SINTVL=200000 BLENGTH=20000 test/lss_burst

DUMPPATH specifies where to save output files (default: working directory).
EPSILON specifies the error threshold for Space Saving - look at the paper!
SINTVL and BLENGTH specify (in nanoseconds) sampling interval and burst 
length, respectively. The larger is SINTVL, the smaller is the number of 
sampled routine activations. Whenever a routine activation is sampled, 
the activations in the following BLENGTH nanoseconds are also taken into 
account by our profiler.

To process a profiler's output file, use the tool 'analysis':

tools/analysis foo-<TID>.tree 0.001

Where 0.001 is an optional value specifying the frequency threshold phi 
for Space Saving - again, take a look at the paper! :)

The analysis tool will produce an output file foo-<TID>.dot containing 
the HCCT in GraphViz format. If GraphViz is installed, graph is created 
also in PNG and SVG. When the graph is very large, you can use 
visualization tools for GraphViz such as ZGRViewer.

Enjoy!
